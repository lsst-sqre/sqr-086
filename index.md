# A data documentation deep linking service with IVOA DataLink

```{abstract}
LSST users retrieve data through VO services, either directly or through clients like the Rubin Science Platform's Portal. IVOA provides a DataLink specification that allows datasets to express relationships with other resources, such as related datasets. This technote outlines a method for using DataLink to also link into the documentation for data, both at the table and column level. With this standards-based approach, clients like the Portal can show descriptions and links to documentation from their user infraces.
